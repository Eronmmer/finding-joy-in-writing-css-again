# The aim?

I haven't written vanilla CSS(pure or whatever you choose to call it) in a while because I've been doing more of backend development in the past few months. This repository contains some FE projects I'm working on just to find out if I still know how to write sematic HTML and mobile first CSS.

## What's in here?

A couple of frontend implementations(HTML, pure CSS and very little JavaScript) of some designs gotten from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmetor.io)
